"""Headless check of the platform split — the N64 half of Project Studio.

The GUI needs a GPU and a window; the decisions that make an N64 session an
N64 session do not. This drives them directly against a synthetic repo:

  * one platform per process, and the PSX/SNES defaults unchanged by its
    existence
  * the capability table, because adding a third console is exactly what makes
    `key == "snes"` and `else` two different claims — every capability an N64
    session answers differently from PSX is asserted here, so a fourth console
    cannot inherit PSX's answers by being spelled differently
  * a separate repo index per console, and repo recognition that refuses to put
    one port in two lists (an n64lle port carries a game.toml, and so does a
    PSX one)
  * the N64 audit / plan / apply ops, end to end, on a scaffold-shaped tree
  * refusal to emit a file whose ROM identity cannot be resolved — the one
    failure mode worth a test, because inventing those values writes a guess
    into a document whose whole value is that its rows are [MEASURED]
  * the three names an n64lle port needs, derived by the SCAFFOLDER's rules,
    because Studio always runs that wizard with --yes and a name Studio
    derived differently would silently disagree with the tree it creates
