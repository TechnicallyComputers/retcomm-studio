// studio_n64.hpp — the N64 Diagnostics tab: drive n64lle's Ares oracle, run its
// differential gates, and read the runtime's always-on rings.
//
// Why this tab exists NOW when it deliberately did not before
// -----------------------------------------------------------
// The old call — recorded in studio_model.hpp and README.md — was that N64 had
// no Diagnostics tab because "its debug server implements only
// ping/ring_stats/ring_query/help". That was true of the RUNTIME's server and
// is still true. What changed is that n64lle's Ares oracle (n64ref) now builds
// off Windows, so the whole differential toolset it gates — command, pixel,
// frame and scanout — is reachable from a Linux host for the first time
// (n64lle docs/evidence/ORACLE-LINUX-PORT-STUDY.md). The tab is about the
// ORACLE and the GATES, which is a different surface from the one that was
// missing, and the rings are a third thing that was always there.
//
// It is still NOT a Functions tab. Discovery on n64lle is execution-derived
// inside the harvest and a port carries no symbol table, so there remains
// nothing for that tab to read and it stays absent.
//
// Division of labour, same as the other two Diagnostics tabs
// ----------------------------------------------------------
// The tools own the protocol and the verdict; Studio is a launcher and a
// viewer. tools/n64_analysis/n64_oracle.py owns the oracle lifecycle and the
// pin check; n64lle's own coordinators (tools/rdp_*_differential.py,
// rdp_frame_gate.py, vi_scanout_differential.py, gate2_determinism.py) own
// every comparison. Nothing here decides whether two images match, so a
// headless gate run and this tab can never disagree about a result.
//
// Why no second debug client: n64lle's debug server and n64ref speak the SAME
// id-framed JSON-over-TCP protocol — that is n64ref's stated design, "every
// debug and co-simulation tool works against either backend by switching
// ports". DebugClient already frames exactly that way and heartbeats on
// `ping`, which n64lle implements; its PSX-only polling is gated behind
// live-trace, which N64 never turns on. So this tab reuses the existing
// clients rather than adding a third.
